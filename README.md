# Titanic Survival EDA 🧊🚢

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns using Python.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 What’s Covered
- Data loading and cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, countplots, scatterplot, heatmap, pairplot
- Key insights about gender, class, fare, and age vs survival

## 📌 Key Findings
- Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher fare often meant better survival
- Missing values in Age and Embarked handled
- Cabin dropped due to many missing entries

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Place `train.csv` in the same folder
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
